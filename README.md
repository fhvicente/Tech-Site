# Tech-Site
This project was created during my university studies. It is a simple website that incorporates several JavaScript-based features, including:

- Cookies: The website utilizes cookies to capture and display the number of visits. Each time the website is accessed, the visit count is stored in a cookie and presented to the user.

- AJAX: AJAX is employed to dynamically change the text when the mouse hovers over a specific element. This interactive feature enhances the user experience by providing real-time updates.

- Dynamic banner: The website includes a dynamic banner that automatically changes its content after every 5 seconds. This feature adds visual interest and keeps the website engaging for users.

Additionally, the website utilizes PHP and jQuery to enhance its functionality and provide seamless integration between client-side and server-side operations. The menu system ensures easy navigation throughout the website, enhancing user accessibility.
